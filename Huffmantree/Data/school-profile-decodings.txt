School of Remote Sensing Information Engineering is an information and engineering college that integrates remote sensing, surveying and mapping, and spatial information engineering technology.Since 1956, after more than 60 years' hard work by the pioneer of surveying and mapping, the founder of photogrammetry and remote sensing, academician Zhizhuo WANG, and the academic leaders, academician Deren LI, academician Zuxun ZHANG, academician Jianya GONG, and other experts and scholars, the college has preliminarily formed a complete talent training system from bachelors, masters, doctors to postdocs.It has always been among the top universities in China, delivering more than 10,000 senior professionals to society, and is praised by the industry as the cradle of talent training in surveying and remote sensing in China and even the world.At present, the college has four major disciplines for bachelor degrees, namely, "remote sensing science and technology", "national geo-information monitoring", "geographic information engineering", "spatial information and digital technology", four master of science degree authorization stations, namely, "photogrammetry and remote sensing", "cartography and geographic information system", "pattern recognition and intelligent system", "remote sensing science and technology", and a master of engineering degree authorization station of "resources and environmental engineering".There are three doctoral degree authorization stations: "photogrammetry and remote sensing", "cartography and geographic information engineering", "remote sensing science and technology", and the post-doctoral research station of "surveying and mapping science and technology".Among them, "remote sensing science and technology" is a national first-class undergraduate discipline, and "photogrammetry and remote sensing" is the first batch of national key disciplines approved by theMinistry of Education.It belongs to "surveying and mapping science and technology", which is a national first-class key discipline, and it was selected as a "double first-class" construction discipline of theMinistry of Educationin 2017. In 2018, "remote sensing science and technology" was approved as the first batch of interdisciplinary subjects to have the doctoral degree authorization station.
